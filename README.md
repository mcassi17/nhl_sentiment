# NHL Sentiment Analysis
This NHL Sentiment Analysis aims to rank all 31 NHL teams according to the positivity/negativity (sentiment) of Twitter tweets. The tweets were collected from January 20th through January 25th 2018, which was right before the All-Star break.
<br><br>
The repository contains the files for the gathering tweets about all 31 NHL teams from Twitter, cleaning the Twitter data, and exploring the initial dataset. It also contains the images that were not used in the Milestone Report, including tweets by hour of the day and word clouds.
<br><br>
Additional files will be added when the analysis is complete. These files will include additional cleaning notebooks as well as the actual sentiment analysis portion of the project.
